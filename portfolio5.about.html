<!--About Me      -->

			<div class="row borders">
				<p>
				
				My interest in Human Computer Interaction is influenced by my work as an artist and business owner, collegiate athlete, and computer program developer.
				<br>
				<br>
				I founded BoyerArt in 2010 to design and sell graphics to clients including Whole Foods, Crispin Porter and Bugusky, and The University of Colorado.  However, I learned most about design selling legal unlicensed art for the fans of rock super-group Phish.
				<br>
				<br>
				My business challenge was to create screen-printed rock-posters without infringing on Phish’s trademarks. I had to create better artwork and customer experience to compete with vendors who had access to these trademarks. My work incorporates Phish narratives, worldviews, and deep understanding of its fans and culture. The product was high quality, consistently recognizable artwork which gathered a following within the Phish community. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I also developed a unique customer experience. I studied my competitors purchasing “interface” and it flaws, and envisioned design alternatives using divergent thinking to develop a successful service and product. In order to purchase a licensed poster, patrons wait in line hours before the venue opens. After opening, the line resembles a Black-Friday sale. Customers scramble to the merchandise table and are presented with unfriendly staff or a sold-out product. With poster in hand, they remain inside the venue through the duration of a concert -- often losing, damaging, or ruining their just-purchased artwork.
				<br>
				<br>
				In contrast to my competitors, BoyerArt prints were well advertised and accessible online at www.boyerart.com , posted on several social media sites, and available at venues hours before the show. After their purchase, patrons could safely return their packaged poster to their home, hotel, car, or have it safely shipped. 
				<br>
				<br>
				When my product was not purchased online, my in-person retail shoppers were delighted with personal connection, nostalgia, and raw energy I brought to each sale. They were greeted with a smile, eye contact, and conversation of their favorite subject matter, Phish. We chatted about shows, expectations, and the poster’s Phish related topics. I learned that the way the customer feels when they buy the product, is often the product.  
				<br>
				<br>
				Since 2012, BoyerArt has grossed over $450,000 selling unlicensed Phish posters, and was honored to create officially licensed artwork in 2015.
				<br>
				<br>
				After winning two consecutive Illinois State Gymnastics Championships, I was recruited to the University of Illinois Division I Gymnastics Team. I was selected as Team Captain my Junior and Senior years. 
				<br>
				My role as Team Captain was to motivate and encourage teammates using concepts similar to the design principles including empathy. I learned that leaders who understand the needs of their team, can offer support to deal with challenges that may prevent them from achieving their goals. After 4 years of competition I was accepted as Assistant Coach where we won the Big Ten Championship. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Gymnastics taught me the value of empathy, teamwork, and of mastering the basics. When the basics are mastered, advanced skills are second nature.  I would like to master the basics of design  to become a leader in the UX field.
				<br>
				<br>
				Lastly, in the fall of 2017, I attended CodeCraft School of Technology in Boulder. I learned the full-stack technical skills to develop advanced applications. Programming skills allow me to know what is realistic in design, and how to push the limits of creativity. It allows me to create prototypes and examples to share with developers, eliminating misunderstandings. I can now consider things that might have otherwise been overlooked, like loading times, code complexity, and code maintenance. I can make objective decisions backed by technical reasons.
				<br>
				<br>
				Good user experience improves communication between a product and its users, and communication begins in the design process itself. The training was a prerequisite to my desire to master clear communication with developers using a common language.
				<br>
				<br>	
				On January 15 2018, I will begin a UX design internship with Sovos, an international software
				development firm, to design high fidelity deliverables and interactive prototypes. I am extremely excited for this next challenge and hope to expand my design vocabulary and skills.
				<br>
				<br>
				Analyzing and redesigning Phish poster sales helped me understand the importance of consumer experience. My role as team captain trained me to understand the value of empathy, and computer programming skills allow me to communicate clearly with developers. I am excited to continue learning the principals of Human Computer Interaction by discovering opportunities based on user data. I am eager to learn new media, create various prototypes, understand project management skills, and master user empathy.
